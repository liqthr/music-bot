# Sentry Integration Notes

## Known Historical Issues

### SentryExampleAPIError (RESOLVED)

**Issue ID:** JAVASCRIPT-NEXTJS-TX-1  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved - No action required  
**Route:** `GET /api/sentry-example-api`

#### Description
This error was generated by Sentry's Next.js integration wizard test/example code. The route `/api/sentry-example-api` was created automatically when the Sentry Next.js wizard was initially run to verify that error tracking was working correctly.

#### Root Cause
- The Sentry Next.js setup wizard (`npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs`) automatically creates example routes to test error tracking
- The route `app/api/sentry-example-api/route.ts` intentionally threw a `SentryExampleAPIError` to verify Sentry integration
- This code has since been removed from the codebase

#### Current Status
- ✅ The example route has been **removed** from the codebase
- ✅ No Sentry example files exist in the current code
- ℹ️ The errors visible in Sentry are **historical records** from development/testing
- ℹ️ All 23 occurrences happened on `localhost:3000` during initial Sentry setup testing

#### Resolution
**No code changes required.** The issue has already been resolved by removing the Sentry example code from the codebase. The errors appearing in Sentry are historical artifacts that can be:
- Marked as "Resolved" in the Sentry dashboard
- Archived or ignored as they represent test data, not real application errors

#### Verification
You can verify the example code has been removed by searching for:
```bash
# These searches should return no results:
grep -r "sentry-example-api" app/
grep -r "SentryExampleAPIError" .
find . -name "sentry*.config.*" -o -name "instrumentation.*"
```

#### Recommendation
When setting up Sentry in the future:
1. Run the Sentry wizard to set up integration
2. Test that errors are being captured correctly
3. **Remove the example/test routes** after verification
4. Mark any test errors in Sentry as "Resolved" or archive them to keep your error dashboard clean
